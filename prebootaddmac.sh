# All executables placed into this directory will be invoked by NC
# at certain points with certain arguments. Currently supported are:
#
#   euca-nc-pre-init      <eucalyptus-home>
#   euca-nc-post-init     <eucalyptus-home>
#   euca-nc-pre-hyp-check <eucalyptus-home>
#   euca-nc-pre-boot      <eucalyptus-home> <instance-home>
#   euca-nc-pre-adopt     <eucalyptus-home> <instance-home>
#   euca-nc-pre-clean     <eucalyptus-home> <instance-home>
#   euca-nc-pre-attach    <eucalyptus-home> <volume-Xml-Path>
#   euca-nc-post-detach   <eucalyptus-home> <volume-Xml-Path>
#
# If the executables return 0, the execution proceeds normally.
# If values [1-99] are returned, NC will abort some operation:
# it will not initialize, or will not run or adopt the instance.
# Any directories or files that cannot be executed are ignored.
#
# Make this bash script executable for it to work.
